Poker Hand Frequency Analysis

This program analyzes a dataset of poker hands from a file and calculates the frequency of each type of poker hand.
It also compares the actual occurrence rates with expected theoretical probabilities.

How It Works:
1. Reads the poker hands dataset from a file (`poker-hand-testing.data`).
2. Parses each line to extract the final hand ranking.
3. Counts occurrences of each hand type.
4. Calculates the percentage occurrence of each hand type.
5. Compares actual probabilities to expected probabilities.
6. Displays the results in a well-formatted table, including an ASCII bar chart for visualization.
